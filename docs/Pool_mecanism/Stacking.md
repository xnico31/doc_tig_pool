# Staking on TIG Pool  

## Introduction  

Staking is an essential mechanism on TIG Pool, required to upgrade a machine to the **Titan** or **Stellar** plan. By staking TIG tokens, you allow TIG Pool to deposit this amount in the TIG self-deposit system, helping to increase the cutoff limit.  

It is important to understand the mechanism and its constraints before performing your first staking operation!

## Staking Rules  

- Once staking is performed, the staked amount will be **blocked for 14 days**.  
- Staking is **automatically renewed weekly** unless you request to unstack your TIG.  
- Before initiating staking, ensure you are fully aware of the constraints associated with the locking period.

## Staking Mechanism  

When you stake your TIG tokens, hereâ€™s how the process works:  

1. **Initial Locking Period:**  
   - Your TIG tokens will be blocked for **14 days** upon staking.  

2. **Automatic Weekly Renewal:**  
   - If you do not request to unstack your tokens, the staking is **automatically renewed for an additional 7 days** every week.  

3. **Unstaking Timeline:**  
   - If you wish to unstack your TIG tokens, the timing of your request is critical.

## Unstaking Scenarios  

Letâ€™s break this down with an example:  

- **Day 0:** You begin staking your TIG tokens on **01.01.2025**.  
- **Day 14:** Your initial staking period ends on **15.01.2025**, but the staking is automatically renewed weekly unless you unstack.  

### Scenario 1: Early Unstaking Request  

- If you request to unstak **before Day 7 (07.01.2025)**, your funds will be **withdrawable on 15.01.2025**.  

### Scenario 2: Late Unstaking Request  

- If you request to unstack **on or after Day 7 (07.01.2025)**, the staking is automatically renewed for another 7 days.  
  - Your funds will then be available at the **end of the renewed period**, which is **22.01.2025**.  

---

## Example  

- **Staking Date:** 01.01.2025  
- **Initial Staking End Date:** 14.01.2025  

### Unstaking Request Timeline:  

1. **Request on 08.01.2025:**  
   - Your staking will have been automatically renewed.  
   - Funds will be available on **21.01.2025**.  

2. **Request on 06.01.2025:**  
   - Staking will still end on **15.01.2025**, as it falls within the renewed 7-day period.

## Summary  

- **TIG Staking Period:** 14 days minimum with automatic weekly renewal.  
- **Unstaking Request Timing:** Be strategic to avoid unnecessary delays in accessing your funds.  

Staking is a key part of maximizing your mining capabilities on TIG Pool. By understanding the rules and timing, you can ensure a seamless experience.
