## Important Notes Before Upgrading  

Before upgrading your machines, it is crucial to ensure you fully understand the staking mechanism and the requirements for each profile.  

- **Understand Staking:**  
  Refer to the documentation: **[Pool Mechanism: Staking](/docs/pool_mecanism/02_stacking)**.  
- **Check Eligibility:**  
  Ensure you meet the minimum requirements for the profile you wish to upgrade to.

## Stellar Upgrade  

To upgrade a machine to the **Stellar profile**, follow these steps:  

1. **Ensure Sufficient TIG Balance:**  
   - You must have TIG tokens available in your pool wallet.  
   - Refer to the documentation: **[Pool Mechanism: Token](/docs/pool_mecanism/03_token)**.  

2. **Upgrade Your Machine:**  
   - Go to the **"Your Workers"** section on your dashboard.  
   - Locate the machine you want to upgrade.  
   - In the **Action** column, click the **Upgrade** button.  
   - If you have the necessary funds, the upgrade will be processed.  

3. **Notes:**  
   - The maximum number of Stellar machines per account is **15**.  
   - To confirm the change:  
     - The badge next to your worker will change to a **lightning bolt icon**.  
     - On your machineâ€™s `pool_tig` screen, the status will now display **Stellar**.

## Titan Upgrade  

Upgrading to the **Titan profile** is slightly different:  

1. **Eligibility:**  
   - You must have a minimum of **2000 TIG** deposited in the **Your Investment** section of your dashboard.  

2. **Upgrade Availability:**  
   - Slots for Titan investments are **limited**.  
   - If the limit has been reached, you will see an alert message when attempting to invest.  

3. **Upgrade Your Machine:**  
   - Once the 2000 TIG requirement is met, you can upgrade your machines to Titan.  
   - Remember, your limit of slaves depends on your total investment amount.
