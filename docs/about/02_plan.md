## Mining Plans on TIG Pool  

To enable mining on TIG Pool, we have created plans tailored to the type of miner you are. Since round 45, TIG has introduced a self-deposit mechanism. This system was designed to ensure that benchmarkers remain invested in the project and to prevent exploitation by botnets. As a result, the pool is required to maintain a minimun of self deposit.  

Currently, we hold about  **204 647 TIG** as a self-deposit, allowing us to maintain a cut-off of **1574  solutions**.  

Here are the three available plans:  

## **Nova (No Staking Required)**  

- Mining possible without any deposit.  
- High pool fees (a portion of the fees is redistributed as a bonus to Titan users).  
- Idle phases when the pool reaches the cut-off to avoid penalizing miners who staked TIG.  
- Limitation: **15 machines per Discord account**.

## **Stellar Plan**  

- Mandatory stake of **115 TIG** per machine.  
- Low pool fees.  
- No idle phases.  
- Limitation: **15 machines per Discord account**.

## **Titan Plan**  

- Entry ticket: **2000 TIG**.  
- Low pool fees.  
- No idle phases.  
- Machine limitation: **115 TIG per machine**. 
- Bonus rewards from Novas fees (based on your invest share).
- Titan slots are limited to a fixed threshold defined by the TiG Pool team.
- New Titan slots are opened every week during payout.

### Additional Notes  

- Plans are cumulative: for example, you can have **10 machines in Nova** and **10 machines in Stellar** under the same account.  
- The self-deposit mechanism not only ensures fairness but also helps maintain the integrity of the mining ecosystem by discouraging exploitation through botnets.  
- The staking limits of **115 TIG per machine** evolve with each round. However, as long as your staking contract remains active, you retain the benefits linked to your contract.  

For example:  
If you upgrade a machine from Nova to Stellar with a stake of **115 TIG**, and in the next round the requirement for Stellar increases to **130 TIG**, your machine will remain in Stellar at **115 TIG**, provided you do not break the staking contract.
